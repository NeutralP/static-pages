## My process
- Needed to find Static Page Framework that I can use to learn Tailwind
- Tried Tanstack Start (SPA), gave up
- Tried Next (for some funny reason), gave up
- Tried Astro, did Blog Post tutorial and did the challenge

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Astro
- Tailwind
- Flexbox

### What I learned

That setting up Prettier is a pain in the ass.
Note to future devs: extension for Prettier in VSCode Marketplace DO NOT use the Legacy one (one that is downloaded more). It doesn't work w/ Astro

Otherwise, you can see my `.prettierrc` for simple set up.

### Continued development

I'll try refactor this blog project tutorial into a showcase of all solution for Frontend Mentor Challenges instead. Right now I just had the solution set up on 1 random page,

### Useful resources

Read the docs. If you don't understand the docs, use chat gpt :smile:
